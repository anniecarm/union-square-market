				<p class="flow-text">When customers walk through Union Square Park during its annual holiday market, it’s impossible not to notice the difference between each stall. And yet, the successful ones all share one thing in common: great design. These stalls attract crowds the same way birds attract potential mates—using bright colors, movement, and sometimes even song. The elaborate and enticing designs influence whether or not customers stop by to investigate the vendors and their products. Retailers that work to create a shopping experience, from the items they are selling to the physical elements that they have built, catch the eyes of customers—and their wallets.</p>
				<p class="flow-text">At the center of the Holiday Market, a stall named ‘Pook’ can be seen. The Canadian apparel company was started by a fine art student, Tony Pook, who designs their various hats, scarves, onesies, and signature ‘Pook Toque’ hats. Their stall is a staple at Union Square, having been present for years. Thomas Ladd runs the Union Square stall. In true Canadian fashion, to set up the stall, he dragged over all of the inventory down to the market in hockey bags. A custom-built elevated table hides inventory from the customer’s eyes. Ladd calls out to passersby, “I'm so warm and cozy, winter is coming, you have to prepare!” drawing people to come to the bright red table and get in on the warm accessory action.</p>
				<blockquote>“I'm so warm and cozy, winter is coming, you have to prepare!”</blockquote><blockquote>Thomas Ladd of Pook</blockquote>

				<p class="flow-text">The main event is a demonstration of the many styles a Pook Toque can accomplish. “Want me to enlighten you?” Ladd asks before diving into an interactive display of the many personas the hat can take on, ranging from a bowler cap to a mullet. Tony Pook, the man behind the Toque, invented a mechanical system of pulleys and wires to lower and raise mannequin legs and hands adorned with Pook socks and gloves. The moving elements grab the customer’s attention, but experiencing the classic Pook spiel delivered by Thomas Ladd seals the deal. The two make the perfect selling machine, something their neighbor picked up on.</p>

				<p class="flow-text">Only two stalls over, another eye-catching stall by the name of ‘Real Life Inspired Planes’ resides. The booth is run by Juan, who is an artist from Bogota, Colombia, who has been a part of the Union Square Holiday Market for seven years now. His stall mirrors the sky, with blue wallpaper decorated with fluffy cotton clouds. Model planes dangle from the ceiling on spring cords which are attached to wires. With a tug on a rope behind a curtain, Juan makes the miniature aircrafts come to life as they bounce up and down on their cords. If this design sounds familiar, that’s because it is. Juan drew inspiration for his stall from his neighbor, Pook. The artist saw how customers were attracted to the moving display and decided to do the same thing. Although he hasn’t quite gotten down the mechanics yet, the stall draws crowds of admiration and customers in the form of kids begging their parents for the life-like planes.</p>

				<p class="flow-text">On the other side of the market, in aisle “A,” customers gravitate to a small stall called ‘With Roots’. Wood panels, moss-covered tree stumps, and jewelry hanging from branches create a slice of nature in the busy market. Sharon Goldberg runs this Brooklyn-based jewelry company by herself. She stands in this stall every week, selling jewelry: necklaces, bracelets, rings, pendants. Each article of jewelry she sells doubles as a terrarium, each safely enclosing preserved plants and flower petals to be admired forever once purchased, but that isn’t always an easy feat. </p>

				<p class="flow-text">Goldberg depends on the design of her booth to attract her customers saying, “I have a small product, so it’s hard to stand out in this market, so you need something to draw you in.” It would be easy for patrons to walk right past her stall, not realizing that these aren't normal necklaces or bracelets, but small masterpieces holding something unique inside each glass pendant. To combat this, Goldberg worked on cultivating the design of her stall for years, finally finding the best set-up for attracting customers.</p>
				<blockquote>"I have a small product so it's hard to stand out in this market, so you need something to draw you in"</blockquote><blockquote>- Sharon Goldberg of With Roots</blockquote>
				<p class="flow-text">When customers to step up to her stall, the first thing they’ll notice is a bed of synthetic grass covering the floor. Then they’ll see that the necklaces are draped on a real slab of tree trunk, decorated with green moss. Three walls of wood paneling encompass the stall and are adorned with jewelry and terrarium ornaments hanging from three-foot tree branches. The elements combined create a “little nature box” that the customers admire and comment on. Like Pook, Goldberg tweaks her stall’s design each year, adapting to the aspects that the customers respond to the most.</p>
				<p class="flow-text">Whether it be motion, sound, bright colors, or all of the above, unique designs are the best way for businesses to entice customers at the Holiday Market. Pook, Real Life Inspired Planes, and With Roots each successfully incorporated different aspects into their booth designs, and became some of the most sought-after booths in the market. With small spaces, every detail counts, and their design execution grabs the attention of people walking throughout the market long enough to stop in and see what’s being sold. Design first, products second, that is the way of life and success at the Union Square Holiday Market.</p>
